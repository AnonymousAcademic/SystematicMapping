However, the implementation of code offload system on edge devices today is largely depending on backbone routers or cloud servers, imposes a significant burden on network traffic while ignores the potentials of utilizing Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices physically nearby. In this article, we seek to obviate such limitations in improper code offload on edge devices, preferably focusing on minimizing interdomain data transfer and cross-device I/O cost while maximizing the CPU computation capability. First, we conduct the most in-depth and efficient analysis of both performance optimization and extra system burden. Second, we identify a new research problem of flexibly selecting the computation-intensive codes to offload at OS runtime across heterogeneous hardwares. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a fast and distributed code offload principle for edge devices called codeSpec, that shifts the destined devices from interdomain servers to IoT devices nearby, and only offloads binary code of user-specified regions across different instruction set architectures, thus to not only improve the system performance (by up to 80%) but also reduce burdens on data transfer (by at least 61%) and I/O latency (by on average 84%) than existing. codeSpec also makes user to flexibly specify the codes for offloading by plugging-in features, and is friendly to the commercial-off-the-shelf devices.},

In this paper, we revise the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method and propose a 3-layer AHP-based risk assessment model (3aRAM) for an Industrial IoT cloud (PaaS platform) to allow the cloud system to self-benchmark its own security status.

To refrain from unnecessary experts involving into the risk assessment phase, a feedback mechanism is designed in the proposed model. We realize the risk assessment system and apply it to an industrial IoT cloud system. Finally, we estimate the practicality of our system by injecting different degrees of noises and launching DoS attacks, and show the change of integrity and availability scores, which are generated by the proposed risk assessment model.},

Industrial IoT paradigm includes all the components to realize predictive systems, like the anomaly detection ones. In this case, the goal is to discover patterns, in a given dataset, that do not resemble the 'normal' behavior, to identify faults, malfunctions or the effects of bad maintenance. The use of complex neural networks to implement deep learning algorithm for anomaly detection is very common. The position of the deep learning algorithm is one of the main problem: this kind of algorithm requires both high computational power and data transfer bandwidth, rising serious questions on the system scalability. Data elaboration in the edge domain (i.e. close to the machine) usually reduce data transfer but requires to instantiate expensive physical assets. Cloud computing is usually cheaper but Cloud data transfer is expensive. In this paper a test methodology for the comparison of the two architectures for anomaly detection system is proposed. A real use case is described in order to demonstrate the feasibility. The experimental results show that, by means of the proposed methodology, edge and Cloud solutions implementing deep learning algorithms for industrial applications can be easily evaluated. In details, for the considered use case (with Siemens controller and Microsoft Azure platform) the tradeoff between scalability, communication delay, and bandwidth usage, has been studied. The results show that the full-cloud architecture can outperform the edge-cloud architecture when Cloud computation power is scaled.},

However, conventional cryptographic security solutions often lead to heavy computations and high energy costs, which can hardly be afforded by resource-constrained IoT edge devices. Therefore, it is essential to retrieve real testing data and investigate the tradeoff between information security and its resource consumption on IoT edge devices. This paper explores the duration and energy consumption of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), implemented through both software and hardware with various key and buffer size settings on two resource-constrained IoT edge devices. In particular, we observe that (1) compared to software, the hardware implementation is more sensitive to buffer size settings and only consumes lower overall time and energy when the buffer size is sufficiently large; (2) the security premium provided by an increase in key size leads to increased resource consumption in all cases; and (3) comparing the two IoT boards, the CYW board, which is designed with faster default CPU clock rate and more memory, consumes fewer resources overall than the BCM board. These observations not only help advance the understanding of the trade-off between IoT devices' security needs and resource consumption, but also shed light on future improvement of light-weight security designs.},

Main goal was to make smart meter by the 'Do It Yourself' method spending as much less founds as it is possible, by keeping user friendly interface, data validity, accuracy of measurement and ease of use for final user. Data gathering is achieved in almost 1 ms which is excellent for custom made device. However, the measured values should be calculated to RMS values to be usable for energy analyzes and further processing of information.},

In this research, different quality models for IoT systems have been studied and compared regarding the quality factors. Besides, a new quality model for IoT has been proposed.

To avoid these problems, we propose a novel approach to BLE application testing that employs emulation using the newly designed BluMoon architecture, which is a BLE emulation system with utilization software. The BluMoon emulation system design follows the communication model of actual BLE. However, BluMoon uses software-implemented pseudo controllers instead of physical controllers. Interaction with remote devices is emulated through exchange of virtual packets, where each virtual packet encapsulates an entire BLE link layer packet format in its payload. Here, we implement a pseudo controller with an advertising function, establishing a connection and exchanging data. We also evaluate the BluMoon implementation performance and measure the resource usage at BluMoon execution, the received packet loss rate, and the response time of HCI command execution. The results show that BluMoon exhibits performance satisfactory for practical application, for all measured items.},

Nowadays real-time IoT software is used to satisfy the needs and functions of a user and it is assisted in this by the hardware. Software testing is generally used to detect bugs and errors and eliminate them to produce a high quality, reliable software. The automated testing depends on the kind of approach taken. This testing may be poorly implemented which results in a low quality software or it may be effectively implemented which results in a high quality software. Automated IoT software testing can decrease time and cost. When these techniques are identified, the cost and time can be reduced. The automated testing is based on three steps such as analyzing the test case, test execution and log analyzer. These steps provide user friendly software with high standard. The automated process provides test reusability and repeatability and saves the test coverage cost and time.

The proposed system consists of three components : the sensor-actuator equipped device and its web based client counterpart acting as both publisher/subscriber, and MQTT broker. In order to send its sensing data to user, each device periodically publish a message with specific topic. In another side, user subscribe to that topic for getting the latest data from a device. The similar natures are applied for communication in reverse direction i.e. the user giving command to device. For enabling web access to the system, web based client utilize MQTT through websocket protocol to communicate with broker while the device utilize MQTT on top of pure TCP/IP stack to reduce the communication overhead. From the functional and performance testing we conclude that the proposed system is able to bridge the communication between web based client to the device with reasonable performance.},

Publisher/subscriber first sends its username password to authentication server to get the token. Notice that, the token generating process is only performed at following conditions : 1) when token has not been generated yet and 2) when token has been expired. Once publisher get a valid token, it will store that token in its local storage and use it for further authentication.

Integration testing can be necessary whenever any central product in the network is updated - hence, the automation of testing is important to save time and resources. In particular, this project focuses on automated testing of security panels for a home security and automation company. Currently, the panels are physically modified so that relays can be used to activate some test scenarios; however, this modification endangers the integrity of the test. Other test scenarios are conducted manually by Quality Engineers. The focus of this paper is on automating testing using robotic actuation and image analytics (IA). The newly designed automated test system (ATS) contains three main subsystems: a test rig that provides fixturing and controls lighting in the test environment, a Cyton Epsilon 300 robotic arm that pushes buttons on a panel and activates specific sensors, and an IA system (IAS) to determine the state of the panel. The IAS takes pictures of the alarm panel in states such as 'Armed' or 'Disarmed' and determines the panel's state using template matching in OpenCV. Using this feedback, the ATS automatically determines if the panel successfully completed the test. Test results include accuracy testing on the robotic arm, which can mark a piece of paper with a pen 100 times without any noticeable drift and only three misses. Further, template matching was shown to correctly detect six panel states when panel position and lighting were held constant. These findings highlight the importance of a test rig to control position and lighting. Finally, user testing demonstrated a setup time of under 30 minutes, which compares favorably to the day or more required to set up the current testing system.},

Web Service Matchmaking is a process of searching (or discovering) for a web service within a service registry (such as UDDI) to discover a web service that satisfies certain functional requirements as requested by a service consumer. In this paper, we present a hybrid web service matchmaker that analyzes both the signature and specification of a web service. For signature level service matching, we have developed two techniques: (i) logical similarity measures applied to the services' input/output concepts, and (b) non-logical matching based on a Structure Preserving Semantic Matching algorithm. For specification matching, we have introduced a short sentence matching approach applied to a services' description. We evaluated the performance of the matchmaker using the OWLS-TC dataset, and furthermore compared its performance with the similar hybrid matchmaker. Our results indicate a significant improvement in recall and slight improvement in precision.},

Similar code fragments which are live at different locations are called code clones. These Internet-enabled devices are used for knowledge sharing and data extraction to execute various applications related to code clone detection. However, most of the existing semantic code clone detection techniques are unable to provide heuristic solution for problems such as statement reordering, inversion of control predicates and insertion of irrelevant statements which may cause a performance bottleneck in this environment. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that finds semantic code clones in a program or procedure using data flow analysis on the basis of reaching definition and liveness analysis. The algorithm based on reaching definition and liveness analysis is designed to find similar code fragments which are structurally divergent, but semantically equivalent. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach using reaching definition and liveness analysis is effective in detection of semantic code clones for various applications running on the Internet-enabled devices. We have found 5831 semantically equivalent clone pairs on subject systems taken from DeCapo benchmark after elimination of 29,029 dead codes/statements having 2,16,579 line of code (LOC).},

This stands for the crucial topics since many databases are used these days and it is difficult to choose the right database for specific scenario. The correct choice for specific scenario is very important in e-applications or communication systems, because it is supposed to save a lot of money and effort. This work aims at comparing and testing Elasticsearch and MySQL DB (Database) with related frameworks e.g., Spring Data. This particular comparison is done via searching values in larger key-value datasets. At this point, it is very important to know which database to choose in this scenario, because it is often used in e-applications e.g., when e-application wants to store session ID and user time spent in e-app. Simulation scenarios in this paper were created using real data sets provided by IBM internal e-learning app. Based on performed tests, authors provide the community with a suitable way of storing data.},

While many technology vendors now offer "Big Data" solutions, a challenge for potential customers is understanding quantitatively how these solutions will work for IoT use cases. This paper describes a benchmark toolkit called IoTAbench for IoT Big Data scenarios. This toolset facilitates repeatable testing that can be easily extended to multiple IoT use cases, including a user's specific needs, interests or dataset. We demonstrate the benchmark via a smart metering use case involving an eight-node cluster running the HP Vertica analytics platform. The use case involves generating, loading, repairing and analyzing synthetic meter readings. The intent of IoTAbench is to provide the means to perform "apples-to-apples" comparisons between different sensor data and analytics platforms. We illustrate the capabilities of IoTAbench via a large experimental study, where we store 22.8 trillion smart meter readings totaling 727 TB of data in our eight-node cluster.},

S2aaS can provide crowdsourced data to an application running on a cloud platform. The crowdsourced data can be used for several purposes such as public safety. One of the biggest challenges here is the incentive mechanisms for the users who are requested to provide S2aaS. In this paper, we propose mobility-aware trustworthy crowdsourcing (MATCS) framework in a cloud-centric IoT architecture which adopts and extends a previous scheme, Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) [1] by incorporating user mobility-awareness in the presence of maliciously altered sensing data. MATCS employs a user-centric incentive mechanism which collects sensing data based on an auction procedure. In the auction procedure, MATCS uses users' reputations, bids, current location and their estimated dislocation during crowdsourcing process. Furthermore, in order to investigate the benefits of reputation-awareness, we also propose reputation-unaware Mobility-Aware Crowdsourcing (MACS). Performance of MATCS is evaluated via simulations, and it is compared to MACS and a benchmark scheme, which aims at making a compromise between the utilities of the users and the platform by considering neither mobility nor trustworthiness. Simulation results confirm that mobility-awareness improves the utility of the platform significantly whereas combining reputation-awareness and mobility-awareness by MATCS can triple the improvement. Besides, user incomes are not significantly impacted by MACS or MATCS when users are mobile. Furthermore, maliciously altered data ratio can be degraded by 20%∼55% by reputation-awareness in MATCS.},

Communications in an IoT infrastructure are managed by a set of policies which are determined by Objective Functions (OFs). Thus, OFs are the most important contributors in facing with the mentioned challenges. In this paper, due to the lack of information on how OFs affect the primary properties of an IoT infrastructure, we have compared three well-known OFs (OF0, MRHOF, and OFFL) from power consumption, performance, and reliability perspectives. This paper would pave the way for scholars to realize which of the three mentioned areas are more affected by OFs. Our evaluation results on Contiki's IoT simulation environment (COOJA) illustrate, OFs could affect the power consumption by up to 71.2%, while their impacts on reliability and performance would be as high as 77.5% and 25.15%, respectively.},

MASai is comprised of MASai application on Android phones, MASai box, and MASai server. MASai application allows users to execute penetration testing on targeted IoT devices and targeted mobile applications controlling the devices throughouta mobile interface. MASai application works along with MASai Box, a Raspberry Pi embedded with Kali Linux distribution, to find vulnerabilities of the targeted IoT devices. Several techniques such as information gathering, wireless attacks, and vulnerability scanning are integrated for the assessment. MASai server allows users to perform Android reverse engineering and static code analysis for the mobile application security assessment. All vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are based on OWASP Top 10 IoT Vulnerabilities and OWASP Mobile Top 10. By using MASai, we expect users to gain security awareness and can prevent the unexpected consequences of IoT technology.},

	abstract     = {The IoT platform is a crucial middleware that allows us to walk safely in the field of IoT agriculture. The Rice Intensification System (SRI) uses less water and improves rice yield through the synergy of several agronomic management practices around the world. Rice is a staple crop for many countries and is one of the three main food crops in Central Africa. Environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, disease, acidity and iron toxicity can limit growth and performance. In Central Africa, rice is grown mainly in the lowlands. Africa consumes 11.5 million tons of rice per year, of which 33.6% is imported. Import trends showed only a slight decrease of 55 000 tones, while rice production increased by 2.3 million tones. And Central Africa's average self-sufficiency reached 37.9%. This is new way of more production in agriculture sector for saving a life have to be researched. The most natural one being the use of different machine in farm by connecting different sensors, connected devices, developing intelligent breeding systems as much as possible. In the paper, an architecture based on IoT agriculture is proposed after analyzing of soil organic. This work includes the expansion of rice management scales, including human resources, water and agricultural land; response strategies to irrigation during the drought; and the application of several agricultural water resources. Finally, it presents a architecture for IoT agriculture services based on cloud sensor infrastructure. Our results show that rice should be planted in lowland rice production systems in Central Africa.},

How to develop highquality mote applications efficiently and provide supporting tools has become a great challenge. Because the quality of an mote application is strongly relevant to the behavior patterns of the mote (a behavior pattern in this work is referenced to a commonly occurring way of performing actions of the mode, which resides in the program framework, i.e., the code structure of the program, of the mote application), this paper studies how to design behavior patterns for mote applications, which will act as guidelines for implementing programs, to improve the QoS of applications. This paper first summarizes a collection of fundamental behavior patterns which can be often found in mote applications and then analyzes the relationships between quality properties and behavior patterns of mote applications based on a series of experiments. It also demonstrates how to design code structures to realize the expected behavior patterns in mote applications for improving the QoS of mote applications.},

In order to accommodate massive, energy efficient M2M traffic and to reduce the access delay and signalling overhead, the recommendation is to introduce a clustered network structure. In this effort, we consider machines (or devices) in a macro cell divided into clusters. The machines belonging to a cluster communicate to the cluster head/controller, which then aggregates the traffic and relays to the eNB. Unlike related work that focuses on formation of clusters and their energy consumption, in this paper we investigate the multi-objective optimization problem of throughput maximization and power control of cluster heads in interference-limited M2M communication. Our objective is to maximize the number of admitted MTC device controllers with least interference caused to conventional (human) devices such that their quality of service (QoS) is not affected by the M2M communications. To maximize the number of machines that can communicate while meeting the interference constraints of human devices and machines themselves, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. OPTI toolbox is used to optimize the power, capacity and maximum number of admitted machines collectively. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

In this work we propose a proxy virtualization framework to support scalability and easy implementation of custom functionalities in large WoT deployments. The functionalities offered by a CoAP proxy are exploited to transparently decouple applications from servers and to guarantee the implementation of custom policies and functionalities through virtualization techniques. A solution based on Linux Containers is implemented in a real test bed made of off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed design. Experimental results have shown that the response time is highly improved by our solution thanks to central coordination of concurrent requests from different virtual proxy instances.

Various optimization techniques exist to improve data access performance, such as data prefetching and data layout optimization. However, optimization process is usually a difficult task due to the complexity involved in understanding I/O behavior. Tools that can help simplify the optimization process have a significant importance. In this paper, we introduce a tool, called IOSIG, for providing a better understanding of parallel I/O accesses and information to be used for optimization techniques. The tool enables tracing parallel I/O calls of an application and analyzing the collected information to provide a clear understanding of I/O behavior of the application. We show that performance overheads of the tool in trace collection and analysis are negligible. The analysis step creates I/O signatures that various optimizations can use for improving I/O performance. I/O signatures are compact, easy-to-understand, and parameterized representations containing data access pattern information such as size, strides between consecutive accesses, repetition, timing, etc. The signatures include local I/O behavior for each process and global behavior for an overall application. We illustrate the usage of the IOSIG tool in data prefetching and data layout optimizations. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Since these devices have very basic functionality and are not designed with security in mind, they are easy targets for attacks that can steal data or gain access to the network the devices are connected to. Here we propose a tiered system of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for identifying these attacks and classifying them by type of attack. This system has a tree-based structure, with the main HMM being applied to the raw network data to identify attacks. This main HMM branches off into separate HMMs for each type of attack to classify the attacks according to how important the consequences of the attack are and how likely each attack is to happen.},

	abstract     = {Being an easy-to-deploy and cost-effective low power wireless solution, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely used by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. In a typical IoT scenario, an IoT device first needs to be connected with its companion mobile app which serves as a gateway for its Internet access. To establish a connection, a device first broadcasts advertisement packets with UUIDs to nearby smartphone apps. Leveraging these UUIDs, a companion app is able to identify the device, pairs and bonds with it, and allows further data communication. However, we show that there is a fundamental flaw in the current design and implementation of the communication protocols between a BLE device and its companion mobile app, which allows an attacker to precisely fingerprint a BLE device with static UUIDs from the apps. Meanwhile, we also discover that many BLE IoT devices adopt “Just Works” pairing, allowing attackers to actively connect with these devices if there is no app-level authentication. Even worse, this vulnerability can also be directly uncovered from mobile apps. Furthermore, we also identify that there is an alarming number of vulnerable app-level authentication apps, which means the devices connected by these apps can be directly controlled by attackers. To raise the public awareness of BLE IoT device fingerprinting and also uncover these vulnerable BLE IoT devices before attackers, we develop an automated mobile app analysis tool BleScope and evaluate it with all of the free BLE IoT apps in Google Play store. Our tool has identified 1,757 vulnerable mobile apps in total. We also performed a field test in a 1.28 square miles region, and identified 5, 822 real BLE devices, among them 5, 509 (94.6%) are fingerprintable by attackers, and 431 (7.4%) are vulnerable to unauthorized access. We have made responsible disclosures to the corresponding app developers, and also reported the fingerprinting issues to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.},

Facilitated by programming abstractions such as trigger-action rules, end-users can now easily create new functionalities by interconnecting their devices and other online services. However, when multiple rules are simultaneously enabled, complex system behaviors arise that are diicult to understand or diagnose. While history tells us that such conditions are ripe for exploitation, at present the security states of trigger-action IoT deployments are largely unknown. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between trigger-action rules in order to identify their security risks. Using IFTTT as an exemplar platform, we irst enumerate the space of inter-rule vulnerabilities that exist within trigger-action platforms. To aid users in the identiication of these dangers, we go on to present iRuler, a system that performs Satisiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving and model checking to discover inter-rule vulnerabilities within IoT deployments. iRuler operates over an abstracted information low model that represents the attack surface of an IoT deployment, but we discover in practice that such models are diicult to obtain given the closed nature of IoT platforms. To address this, we develop methods that assist in inferring trigger-action information lows based on Natural Language Processing. We develop a novel evaluative methodology for approximating plausible real-world IoT deployments based on the installation counts of 315,393 IFTTT applets, determining that 66% of the synthetic deployments in the IFTTT ecosystem exhibit the potential for inter-rule vulnerabilities. Combined, these eforts provide the insight into the real-world dangers of IoT deployment misconigurations.},

A successful cross-VM escape attack in the virtualization layer combined with cross-layer penetration in the device layer, which we define as an Advanced Persistent Escaper (APE), poses a great threat. Therefore, the development of detection and rejection methods for APEs across multiple layers in IIoT is an open issue. To the best of our knowledge, less effective methods are established, especially for vulnerability exploitation in the virtualization layer and backdoor leverage in the device layer. On the basis of this, we propose Escaper Cops (EscaperCOP), a detection method for cross-VM escapers in the virtualization layer and cross-layer penetrators in the device layer. In particular, a new detection method for guest-to-host escapers is proposed for the virtualization layer. Finally, a novel encryption method based on Identity-based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is proposed to protect the critical components in EscaperCOP, detection library, and control command library. To verify our method, experimental tests are performed for a large number of APEs in an IIoT framework. The test results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective with an acceptable level of detection ratio.},

The proposed network architecture consists of two types of hidden layers: LSTM layer and full connected dense layer. The LSTM layer is used to model the time series relationship. The fully connected layer is used to map the output of the LSTM layer to a final prediction.

This paper presents an overview of how these systems generally work and why securing them at three different layers that are more important compared to traditional software. Since human beings directly interact with the physical devices, therefore it is important to guarantee that they are secure at any point in time. If an intruder gains control over an autonomous car driving system, the consequences could be life-threatening to many people. Cyber-security is trying to prevent this worst-case scenario but struggles with two major problems: First, CPS/IoT are typically a combination of many separate systems. These systems are often legacy software, which sometimes is no longer up-to-date and could provide many security issues, which are hard to patch since the original developers are not part of the new project. Second, classic security measures aimed at the application and the network layer but CPS/IoT provides a third, physical layer, which needs to be protected. Sensors and actuators are physical parts of the real environment and can be damaged or destroyed by any human intruder or natural disaster if not secured properly. Since security in CPS and IoT have been dramatically neglected in the past years, this paper aims at understanding the security of CPS and IoT. Therefore, in this paper we propose an architecture, where we analyzed the security threats for CPS/IoT. Hence, can easily determine the security requirements for CPS/IoT.},

	abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing an important role in different aspects of our lives. Smart grids, smart cars, and medical devices all incorporate IoT devices as key components. The ubiquity and criticality of these devices make them an attractive target for attackers. Therefore, we need techniques to analyze their security so that we can address their potential vulnerabilities. IoT devices, unlike remote servers, are user-facing and, therefore, an attacker may interact with them more extensively, e.g., via physical access. Existing techniques for analyzing security of IoT devices either rely on a pre-defined set of attacks and, therefore, have limited effect or do not consider the specific capabilities the attackers have against IoT devices. Security analysis techniques may operate at the design-level, leveraging abstraction to avoid state-space explosion, or at the code-level for ensuring accuracy. In this article, we introduce two techniques, one at the design-level, and the other at the code-level, to analyze security of IoT devices, and compare their effectiveness. The former technique uses model checking, while the latter uses symbolic execution, to find attacks based on the attacker's capabilities. We evaluate our techniques on an open source smart meter. We find that our code-level analysis technique is able to find three times more attacks and complete the analysis in half the time, compared to the design-level analysis technique, with no false positives.},

Conducting extensive functional and performance testing is critical to assess the robustness and efficiency of IoT systems in order to validate them before their deployment in real life. However, creating an IoT test environment is a difficult and expensive task, usually requiring a significant amount of physical hardware and human effort to build it. This paper proposes a method to emulate an IoT environment using the Network Emulator for Mobile Universes (NEMU), itself built on the popular QEMU system emulator, in order to construct a testbed of inter-connected, emulated Raspberry Pi devices. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate how our method can be successfully applied to IoT by showing how such an emulated environment can be used to detect anomalies in an IoT system.},

However, data streams produced from distributed sensing devices may not suffice to be processed traditionally in the remote cloud due to: (i) longer Wide Area Network (WAN) latencies and (ii) limited resources held by a single Cloud. To solve this problem, a novel Software-Defined Network (SDN) based InterCloud architecture is presented for mobile edge computing environments, known as EdgeIoT. An adaptive resource capacity management approach is proposed to employ a policy-based QoS control framework using principles in coalition games with externalities. To optimise resource capacity policy, the proposed QoS management technique solves, adaptively, a lexicographic ordering bi-criteria Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem. It is an onerous task to guarantee in a deterministic way that a real-time EdgeIoT application satisfies low latency requirement specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA). CloudSim 4.0 toolkit is used to simulate an SDN-based InterCloud scenario, and the empirical results suggest that the proposed approach can adapt, from an operational perspective, to ensure low latency QoS for real-time EdgeIoT application instances.},

The OFs are responsible for defining rules and constraints to select the best paths considering different routing metrics. In its definition, RPL does not impose the use of a default OF and indicates that an OF should be selected according to the application. Thus, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient and Path Reliability Aware Objective Function (ERAOF) for IoT applications that requires energy efficiency and reliability in data transmission. The ERAOF is based on the composition of energy and link quality routing metrics. Results show that ERAOF is able to improve the network performance when compared to other OFs available in the literature.},

The widespread deployment of IoT devices makes them an attractive target for an attacker trying to gain unauthorized access to an IoT-based system. An adversary clones a real hardware device or compromises embedded software to impersonate a legitimate device, and thus gains unauthorized access to sensitive information and performs security-critical operations. The existing security schemes for the mobile systems cannot be applied directly to an IoT-enabled infrastructure since devices are resource constrained regarding storage, processing power, and communication bandwidth. Additionally, the current security approaches for the IoT systems are unable to identify physically compromised IoT devices. In this paper, we propose HSC-IoT, a resource-efficient Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based security protocol that ensures both software and hardware integrity of IoT devices. HSC-IoT also provides a lightweight mutual authentication scheme for the resource-limited devices based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

Thus, the addition of every new component, and especially new components with external networking capability, increases risks that must be carefully considered. In this paper we examine one of the most active open source home automation framework, Open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) which is used as platform for many other IoT supported devices. First, we go through openHAB security architecture and supported features following the challenge of a static source code analysis of several most used openHAB packages (called bindings) and carefully crafted test cases that revealed many undocumented features of the platform. Next, we exploited security flaws by constructing two proof-of-concept attacks that: (1) openHAB system denial of service; (2) inject custom binding for message bus monitoring and control; We conclude the paper with security best practices for the design of custom openHAB bindings.},

Then we detail an innovative method, based on the evaluation of threats brought by an IoT infrastructure onto an IS. It is represented as a qualitative matrix between IoT infrastructure threats and the Security properties of the IS. The method is then applied to the use case of connected light bulbs. Thanks to this approach, it is possible to logically organize threat management while integrating an IoT infrastructure into an IS.},

Despite this extensive use and diversity, little is known about the benefits, disadvantages, and performance of each middleware platform and how the different platforms compare with each other. This comparison is especially relevant to help the design and dimensioning of IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a set of qualitative dimensions and quantitative metrics that can be used for bench-marking IoT middleware. We use the publication-subscription of a large dataset as use case inspired by a smart city scenario to compare two middleware platforms. The methodology enables us to systematically compare the two middleware platforms. Further, we are able to use our approach to identify inefficiencies in implementations and to characterize performance variations throughout the day, showing that the metrics may also be used for monitoring.},

This paper proposes the use of an SDN gateway as a distributed means of monitoring the traffic originating from and directed to IoT based devices. This gateway can then both detect anomalous behaviour and perform an appropriate response (blocking, forwarding, or applying Quality of Service).

Although ThingML is a promising IoT modeling and specification language which enables the fast development of resource-constrained IoT applications, it lacks the capability to model such uncertainties and quantify their effects. Consequently, within uncertain environments the quality and performance of IoT applications generated from ThingML designs cannot be guaranteed. To explore the overall runtime performance variations caused by environmental uncertainties, this paper proposes a quantitative uncertainty evaluation framework for ThingML-based IoT designs. By adopting network of priced timed automata as the model of computation and statistical model checking as the evaluation engine, our approach can model uncertainties caused by external environments as well as support various kinds of performance queries on the extended ThingML designs. Experimental results of two comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.},

Such support has been offered by browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight for years. In order to provide a deep insight into IoT Web application performance, we implemented two test applications. In the first application, we measured latencies induced by different communication protocols and message encodings, as well as graphics rendering performance, while comparing the performance of different Web platform implementations. In the second application, we compared Web performance of IoT messaging protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, and DDS by measuring the latency of sensor data message delivery and the message throughput rate. Our tests have shown that although Adobe Flash has the best performance at the moment, HTML5 platform is also very capable of running real-time IoT Web applications, whereas Microsoft Silverlight is noticeably behind both platforms. On the other hand, MQTT is the most appropriate messaging protocol for a wide set of IoT Web applications. However, IoT application developers should be aware of certain MQTT message broker implementation shortcomings that could prevent the usage of this protocol.},

Fragmentation in IoT seems to be abundant ranging from the device hardware, operating system and software to device-to-device and device-to-cloud-based infrastructure protocols, to the actual cloud-based infrastructure and tools used for developing and operating software that runs on these two opposite ends of the system. As such it is challenging for a developer to decide the development, deployment and operational technologies for a complete end-to-end IoT solution. In this paper we focus on the performance evaluation and technology selection of the cloud end of the system. Given that a modern IoT cloud infrastructure is based on a microservices platform, we tackle the challenge of the selection of a Microservice Application Server (MAS) among several available in the developer community for the task of data collection from IoT devices. This paper provides two key contributions. First of all we present an empirical evaluation between different JVM-based MASs and corresponding client/frameworks taking into consideration throughput (req/s), memory footprint and binary footprint. Secondly we provide an open-source testbed that can be used for reproducing the current evaluation and for extending the evaluation towards additional MASs that have been implemented in different runtimes/programming languages.},

The necessity of security is increasing these days, ranging from thefts, burglary, accidents, LPG gas leakage and fire detection etc, which all are important aspects of a Home Security System. In this paper, a prototype Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home (SSH) model is developed. Generally a home security system uses signals in terms of alarm of intruder detection. However, the proposed Multi-Functional Secured Smart Home uses a mobile communication (GSM) based Home Security System, which helps to provide a better security to have systems that can be globally connected. In the proposed system a text message is sent, whenever an event from any sensor is detected, so that immediate actions could be taken by the home owner. The proposed SSH sends SMS using GSM-Module and mail through Raspberry Pi micro-controller. The prototype SSH based smart system also uses an Arduino micro-controller board for commands processing and control. The system uses GSM technology, which provides global access to the Smart Home Security System. The prototype SSH, developed at a low cost, can be used for converting existing homes into smart homes at relatively affordable cost and with convenience. The performance testing results of the prototype SSH are encouraging.},

Our security analysis reveals that flaws in the design, implementation, and interaction models of existing locks can be exploited by several classes of adversaries, allowing them to learn private information about users and gain unauthorized home access. To guide future development of smart locks and similar Internet of Things devices, we propose several defenses that mitigate the attacks we present.

Two crucial issues in designing intelligent things are to determine what value-added services they should offer and the subsequent level of reasoning abilities for the things. Therefore, we need to find an optimal match between the hardware capabilities of the things and their software agents' reasoning abilities to deliver value-added services on top of performing their basic IoT functions. In this paper, we present the results of the software analyses represented by a software spectrum and the hardware analyses represented by a hardware spectrum.

One rare place where energy and water coincide is in water heaters, which consume over 30% of household energy in South Africa and collectively pass over 500 billion litres of water annually. These resource-hungry devices are not well managed and tend to be physically inaccessible and difficult to understand for users. The advent of wireless and cloud computing technology brought expectations of simple management of a multitude of devices and the so-called Internet of Things. A few solutions have been proposed for remote water heater management, but these are not scalable, and have not been benchmarked for scalability above tens of units. This paper proposes an end-to-end architecture to monitor and control EWHs based on MQTT, and specific emphasis is placed on the technologies suitable for large-scale cross-domain interoperability.

In this paper, we propose an isolation-based solution to enforce property policies for runtime IoT services. We firstly address the issue of isolation-based service trace observation by establishing and modeling a virtual channel. We then address the issue of isolation-based policy enforcement by dealing with the incompleteness and inconsistency of trace knowledge observed in the virtual channel. Finally, physical systems are introduced into our runtime monitors, where the controllability of IoT services is discussed as an example of service property enforcement.

This paper examines current technical and performance issues in real-Time embedded systems (RTES) including software and systems developed for the Internet of Things (IoT). We describe the model interoperability framework that uses Model Interchange Formats (MIFs) to exchange performance models among modeling tools. Performance models for RTES or IoT require the representation of additional features, and solution methods beyond efficient, exact model solutions. We introduce the extensions then describe the extended meta- model for the model interoperability framework. We conclude with an evaluation of the approach and how it can be used for performance evaluation of RTES and IoT.

In this paper, we claim that traditional approaches to analyze distributed systems are not expressive enough to address this challenge. As a solution to this problem, we present SIoT, a framework to analyze networked systems. SIoT's key insight is to look at a distributed system as a single body, and not as separate programs that exchange messages. By doing so, we can crosscheck information inferred from different nodes. This crosschecking increases the precision of traditional static analyses. To construct this global view of a distributed system we introduce a novel algorithm that discovers inter-program links efficiently. Such links lets us build a holistic view of the entire network, a knowledge that we can thus forward to a traditional tool. We prove that our algorithm always terminates and that it correctly models the semantics of a distributed system. To validate our solution, we have implemented SIoT on top of the LLVM compiler, and have used one instance of it to secure 6 ContikiOS applications against buffer overflow attacks. This instance of SIoT produces code that is as safe as code secured by more traditional analyses; however, our binaries are on average 18% more energy-efficient.},

Most of them have focused on defect analysis and development processes in relation to open source programs. There exists a gap between open source and industrial software projects, which, in particular, relates to different schemes for creating software repositories and development schemes. This is especially true for embedded systems that gain large markets and become more complex. Objective The aim is to explore the software repositories of industrial embedded systems and derive characteristic features in order to evaluate quality and identify problems to do with development processes. Method In this paper we have proposed a novel approach to software repository analysis based on the fine grained exploration of issue tracking and code control repositories. In particular, we distinguish the various activities of project actors (e.g. creating new functions, correcting defects, improving performance, modifying tests) and analyse them in a context, not only of a single project, but also a set of correlated projects that have been developed in the company. These issues have been neglected in the literature. These analyses needed new holistic schemes for repository exploration, including various statistical metrics, text mining, and machine learning techniques. Results In exploring selected industrial projects we have identified that only 40–75% of issues relate to defects; the issue reports and commit descriptions included here comprise a lot of data that has been disregarded in the literature. These data allow us to trace diverse types of code changes and identify imperfections in software repositories. Conclusion We show that fine grained repository analysis gives a broader and more complete view of project development, which may lead to its improvement.},

This problem has been further aggravated by the complete dependence of business enterprises, financial institutions and stock markets on computer hardware and software. It is therefore needed to propose and develop such software evaluation and quality assurance techniques that can fit into the business model's domain and satisfy the customer needs and aspirations. Autonomic computation is an artificial intelligent based approach used to design and develop software systems which can fit into business model and also satisfy customer needs. These systems are built with self-managed policy system. To guarantee their customers a Total Quality Assurance on the business applications being developed, the paper presents some key aspects of domain-specific software and its quality estimation parameter. In this paper, the authors have analyzed the various aspects of quality metrics of autonomic computation suggested by enhanced ISO 9126 quality model. A universally acceptable approach to assure quality for autonomic computing system would be to measure the Autonomicity of a system to determine whether it is autonomic or not. If it is autonomic then “to what extent” is the next question? Autonomicity is an excellent indicator to assure quality of the autonomic software. The approach taken to measure the subjective attribute of Autonomicity is fuzzy theory with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) integrated in it. Human assessment is qualitative and fuzzy technique is best candidate to quantify their opinions. For empirical analysis, three different query optimizers are examined to measure autonomicity. The result of the empirical analysis will be validated using the already proposed results of the research studies. The present study will provide a base for further research in terms of development of applications with autonomic features. It will also help in proposing new metrics for quality characteristics to estimate the overall quality of such application.},

	abstract     = {Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology is used for several applications for exchanging information among various devices. The intelligent IoT based system utilizes an Android operating system because it is also primarily used in mobile devices. One of the main problems for different IoT applications is associated with android vulnerability is its complicated and large size. To overcome the main issue of IoT, the existing studies have proposed several effective prediction models using machine learning algorithms and software metrics. In this paper, we are focused on conducting android vulnerability prediction analysis using machine learning for intelligent IoT applications. We conducted an empirical investigation for examining security risk prediction of 1406 Android applications with varying levels of risk using a metric set of 21 static code metrics and 6 machine learning (ML) techniques. It is observed from results that ML algorithms have different performances for predicting security risks. RF algorithm performs better for Android applications of all risk levels. By analyzing the findings of the conducted empirical study, it is suggested that developers may consider object-oriented metrics and RF algorithm in the software development process for android based intelligent IoT systems.},

	abstract     = {With the growth of data generation speed and its huge volume, the cloud-based infrastructure alone does not meet the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT), thereby leading to inefficiency. By combining fog and cloud computing on the IoT, some processing occurs near the data generation location with a higher speed and without needing a large bandwidth. Cloud and fog computing requires proper management in scheduling, increasing resource efficiency, and reducing consumption costs. In this article, a two-phase scheduling algorithm is presented based on deep learning methods in the field of IoT. The first phase is to decide on the location of the task execution using the clustering method. The second phase involves scheduling the task according to the execution location. In the clustering section, three ideas based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering method have been proposed. In the first and second ideas, the SOM and hierarchical SOM are used to cluster the features of the tasks received from the IoT layer. In the third idea, the feature is extracted, and its dimensions are reduced using the Autoencoder, which is one of the deep learning methods, after which clustering is done. After scheduling each cluster's tasks, comparing the methods presented in the article, it is shown that the feature extraction using deep learning can improve clustering in such a way to reduce the missed rate of tasks in the cloud and fog, as well as their costs.},

	abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted attention from both the academic and industry because of its highly controllable mobility. The UAV has hence become a potential alternative for a large amount of geographically distributed sensors in provisioning sensing service where the information of different locations (e.g., temperature, humidity, pollutant level and traffic condition) are sensed and sent to the ground station (GS). However, the UAV on-board battery is usually limited due to the size and weight constraints, and greatly affects the UAV performance. Practically, the UAV usually needs to return to the GS for recharging before the battery exhaustion. The trajectory routes, therefore, should be well designed to meet the battery capacity constraint and improve the quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we investigate the trajectory optimization of rechargeable UAV for sensing service to minimize the task completion latency. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. A Clone Searching Algorithm (CSA), which clones the rechargeable UAV into several non-rechargeable virtual UAVs and simultaneously search trajectory routes for each virtual UAV, is then designed to reduce the computational complexity of MILP. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Cyber-physical systems having quality-of-service (QoS) requirements driven by the dynamics of the physical environment in which they operate. The development of cyber physical is challenging due to conflicting quality-of-service (QoS) constraints that must be explored as trade-offs among a series of alternative design decisions. The ability to model a set of possible design alternatives and to analyze and simulate the execution of the representative model helps derive the correct set of QoS parameters needed to satisfy cyber physical system requirements. The description, control, management, consultation and guarantee of QoS are very complex and challenging work, Quality of Service(QoS) is directly related to system's performance. This paper proposes an aspect-oriented QoS modeling method based on UML and formal methods. We use an aspect-oriented profile by the UML meta-model extension, and model the crosscutting concerns by this profile. In this paper, we build the aspect-oriented model for specifying Quality of Service (QoS) based on the combination of UML and RTL. We believe that the two types of notation, graphical (semi-formal) and, respectively, formal, can efficiently complement each other and provide the basis for an aspect-oriented specification approach that can be both rigorous and practical for QoS modeling.

In this context, this paper proposes a novel malware classification with fine-tune convolution neural networks (MCFT-CNN) model. The MCFT-CNN model detects the unknown malware sample without feature engineering and prior knowledge of binary code analysis or reverse engineering, even the advanced evading techniques used to develop the malware. The model uses deep transfer learning to classify the malware images to their respective malware families. The proposed model enhances the ResNet50 model by altering the last layer with a fully connected dense layer. The output of fully connected dense layer and knowledge of ImageNet model are supplied to softmax layer for malware classification. The model is trained with MalImg malware datasets. The proposed model reported 99.18% accuracy and 5.14ms prediction time. The model also shows consistent performance with a relatively larger dataset (Microsoft malware challenge dataset, approximately 500GB) with 98.63% accuracy and 5.15ms prediction time.

In this sense, this paper investigates the use of Machine Learning algorithms to predict acceptable behaviour in system performance of a new software release. By monitoring the real performance, eventual unexpected problems can be identified. Based on previous knowledge and actual run-time information, the proposed approach predicts the response time that can be considered acceptable for the new software release, and this information is used to identify problematic releases. The mechanism has been applied to the post-deployment monitoring of traffic algorithms in elevator systems. To evaluate the approach, we have used performance mutation testing, obtaining good results. This paper makes two contributions. First, it proposes several regression learners that have been trained with different types of traffic profiles to efficiently predict response time of the traffic dispatching algorithm. This prediction is then compared with the actual response time of the new algorithm release, and provides a verdict about its performance. Secondly, a comparison of the different learners is performed.},

Gaussian pulse shaping is a missing piece in state-of-the-art BLE backscatter systems. Inspired by active BLE and applying calculus, we present IBLE, a BLE backscatter communication system that achieves full compatibility with commodity BLE devices. IBLE leverages the fact that phase shift is the integral of frequency over time to build a reliable physical layer for BLE backscatter. IBLE uses instantaneous phase shift (IPS) modulation, GFSK modulation, and optional FEC coding to improve the reliability of BLE backscatter communication to the commodity level. We prototype IBLE using various commodity BLE devices and a customized tag with FPGA. Empirical results demonstrate that IBLE achieves PERs of 0.04% and 0.68% when the uplink distances are 2 m and 14 m respectively, which are 280x and 70x lower than the PERs of the state-of-the-art system RBLE. On the premise of meeting the BER requirements of the BLE specification, the uplink range of IBLE is 20 m. Since BLE devices are everywhere, IBLE is readily deployable in our everyday IoT applications.},

	abstract     = {A printed circuit board (PCB) provides necessary mechanical support to an electronic system and acts as a platform for connecting electronic components. Counterfeiting and in-field tampering of PCBs have become significant security concerns in the semiconductor industry as a result of increasing untrusted entities in the supply chain. These counterfeit components may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturers. While Integrated Circuit (IC) level authentication using physical unclonable functions (PUFs) has been widely investigated, countermeasures at the PCB level are scarce. These approaches either suffer from significant overhead issues, or opportunistic counterfeiters can breach them like clockwork. Besides, they cannot be extended to system-level (both chip and PCB together), and their applications are also limited to a specific purpose (i.e., either counterfeiting or tampering). In this article, we introduce SILVerIn, a novel systematic approach to verify the authenticity of all chips used in a PCB as well as the board for combating attacks such as counterfeiting, cloning, and in-field malicious modifications. We develop this approach by utilizing the existing boundary scan architecture (BSA) of modern ICs and PCBs. As a result, its implementation comes at a negligible (∼0.5%) hardware overhead. SILVerIn is integrated into a PCB design during the manufacturing phase. We implement our technique on a custom hardware platform consisting of an FPGA and a microcontroller. We incorporate the industry-standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface to transmit test data into the BSA and perform hands-on measurement of supply current at both chip and PCB levels on 20 boards. We reconstruct these current values to digital signatures that exhibit high uniqueness, robustness, and randomness features. Our approach manifests strong reproducibility of signatures at different supply voltage levels, even with a low-resolution measurement setup. SILVerIn also demonstrates a high resilience against machine learning-based modeling attacks, with an average prediction accuracy of ∼51%. Finally, we conduct intentional alteration experiments by replacing the on-board FPGA to replicate the scenario of PCB tampering, and the results indicate successful detection of in-field modifications in a PCB.},

	abstract     = {Network simulation is a fundamental service for performance testing and protocol design in wireless networks. Due to the wireless dynamics, it is highly challenging to provide repeatable and reliable simulation results that are comparable to the empirical experimental results. To achieve repeatability for simulation, the existing works focus on reproducing the behaviors on individual links. However, as observed in recent works, individual link behaviors alone are far from enough to characterize the protocol-level performance. As a result, even if the link behaviors can be simulated very closely, these works often fail to simulate the protocol performance with high reliability. In this article, we propose a novel performance-aware simulation approach which can preserve not only the link-level behaviors but also the performance-level behaviors. We first combine the spatial-temporal link diversity to devise an accurate performance model. Based on the model, we then propose a Performance Aware Hidden Markov Model (PA-HMM), where the protocol performance is directly fed into the Markov state transitions. Compared to the existing works, PA-HMM is able to simulate both link-level behaviors and high-level protocol performance. We conduct extensive testbed and simulation experiments with broadcast and anycast protocols. The results show that 1) the proposed model is able to accurately characterize communication performance for both broadcast and anycast and 2) the protocol performance is closely simulated as compared to the empirical results and the PA-HMM based simulation is more repeatable compared to the existing works.},

	abstract     = {Recently voice-controlled virtual assistants (VA) in smart speakers or smartphones have been popular. As VA provides interactive services by executing complicated processes such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, service invocation, and TTS generation jobs, its functions are performed in the cloud. However, we do not know why the response time of voice commands is slow and what is the performance bottleneck of the VA service. In this paper, we present a comprehensive VA performance measurement framework that analyzes the timing events and the response time by processing audio, video and packets. From experiments of 414 voice commands with five smart speakers and 178 commands for two VAs in smartphones, we observed that 24.9% of voice commands are completed within two seconds and 63.2% within three seconds and 36.8% of voice commands over three seconds result in poor user experiences. In particular, 96.2% of music commands and 66.7% of IoT control commands show the slow response time longer than three seconds. We found that our performance measurement tool is useful for finding the slow service such as music and news with the overhead of extracting the user intent from the voice command, the content app startup delay, and the initial playback time. Our tool shows that IoT control with a smart speaker produces the slow response time.},

	abstract     = {Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the 'things' in the growing Internet of Things (IoT) - one based on multi-hop mesh networks, using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in Low-Power Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRa™ technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},
